```
```

This name is a bit long so let's trim it down with

```
mv Object-Detection-on-Raspberry-Pi tensorflow
```

We are now going to create a Virtual Environment to avoid version conflicts with previously installed packages on the Raspberry Pi. First, let's install virtual env with

```
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

Now, we can create our ```tensorflow``` virtual environment with

```
python3 -m venv tensorflow
```

There should now be a ```bin``` folder inside of our ```tensorflow``` directory. So let's change directories with

```
cd tensorflow
```

We can then activate our Virtual Envvironment with

```
source bin/activate
```

**Note: Now that we have a virtual environment, everytime you start a new terminal, you will no longer be in the virtual environment. You can reactivate it manually or issue ```echo "source tensorflow/bin/activate" >> ~/.bashrc```. This basically activates our Virtual Environment as soon as we open a new terminal. You can tell if the Virtual Environment is active by the name showing up in parenthesis next to the working directory.**

When you issue ```ls```, your ```tensorflow``` directory should now look something like this

## Step 3: Installing TensorFlow, OpenCV, and other Prerequisites
To make this step as user-friendly as possible, I condensed the installation process into 2 shell scripts. 

- ```get-prerequisites.sh```: This script installs OpenCV, TensorFlow 2.2.0, and matplotlib along with the dependencies for each module
- ```install-object-detection-api.sh```: This script clones the tensorflow/models repo, compiles the protos, and installs the Object Detection API through an Environment Variable

To install all the prerequisites needed, use

```
bash get-prerequisites.sh
```
This took me around 5-10 minutes, so you can sit back and relax for a bit! Once finished running, the following message should be printed

```
Prerequisites Downloaded Successfully
```

You can test your installation by entering

```
python
Python 3.7.3 (default, Jul 25 2020, 13:03:44)
[GCC 8.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> print (tf.__version__)
```

If everything was installed properly, you should get ```2.2.0```. This means we can now setup the Object Detection API with

```
source ./install-object-detection-api.sh
```

You should a similar success message looking like this

```
TensorFlow Object Detection API Setup Successfully!
```

To test out this installation, another similar step looking like this

```
python
Python 3.7.3 (default, Jul 25 2020, 13:03:44)
[GCC 8.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import object_detection
```

If everything went according to plan, the object_detection module should import without any errors.

**Note: Similar to the Virtual Environment, everytime you start a new terminal, the $PYTHONPATH variable set by the shell script will no longer be active. This means you will not be able to import the object_detection module. You can reactivate it manually with ```export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/pi/tensorflow/models/research:/home/pi/tensorflow/models/research/slim``` everytime you open a new terminal or issue ```echo "export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/pi/tensorflow/models/research:/home/pi/tensorflow/models/research/slim" >> ~/.bashrc```. This sets the system variable upon opening a new terminal.**

## Step 4: Preparing our Object Detection Model

For this step, there are two options. You can use one of the TensorFlow Pre-Trained Object Detection Models which can be found in the [TensorFlow 2 Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md). Or you can train your own Custom Object Detector with the TensorFlow 2 Custom Object Detection API. Later on, I will cover both of these options a bit more extensively. First let's create a directory to store our models. Since we already have a folder named ```models```, let's call it ```od-models```.

```
mkdir od-models
```

Then let's cd into it with

```
cd od-models
```

Now, let's cover both options with more detail.

### Option 1: Using a TensorFlow 2 Pre-Trained Model
For this guide, I will be using this option. TensorFlow's pre-trained models are trained on the [2017 COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home) containing a variety of common, everyday, objects. TensorFlow 2's new ```saved_model``` format consists of a ```saved_model.pb``` and a ```variables``` directory. These two hold weights and the actual inference graph for object detection. The TensorFlow 2 Model Zoo can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md).

As you can see, there's tons of models to choose from! However, you probably noticed that I circled Speed in red. Since we are running on a Raspberry Pi, we're going to have to use one of the faster models. I'd recommend sticking to models with speeds under 40 ms. For this guide, I'll be using the SSD MobileNet v2 320x320 model. This is the fastest model, but there will be a small drop in accuracy. Let's download the model to our Raspberry Pi with

```
wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/ssd_mobilenet_v2_320x320_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz
```
If you plan to use a different model, right-click the name of the model and copy the download link. Then use that after wget instead of the link I provided. We can then extract the contents of the tar.gz file with

```
tar -xvf ssd_mobilenet_v2_320x320_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz
```

This name is a bit long and confusing to work with so let's rename it with

```
mv ssd_mobilenet_v2_320x320_coco17_tpu-8 my_mobilenet_model
```

Once done so, our model should be ready for testing!

### Option 2: Using a TensorFlow Custom Object Detector
If you wanted to detect an object that's not in the COCO Dataset, this is the option for you! Recently, I made a video with more details on training a Custom Object Detector with TensorFlow 2. 

[![Link to my vid](https://github.com/armaanpriyadarshan/Object-Detection-on-Raspberry-Pi/blob/master/doc/Thumbnail2.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqd54apcgGE)

After you've followed all the steps mentioned in the video, you should end up with a ```labelmap.pbtxt``` file and a ```saved_model``` folder. You'll need to transfer these two files to our ```od-models``` directory on the Raspberry Pi. I usually use an SFTP Client such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) to transfer files, but you can use whatever you want. Once your ```od-models``` directory contains your ```labelmap.pbtxt``` and ```saved_model```, you are ready to test!

## Step 5: Running Object Detection on Image, Video, or Pi Camera

Once your model is ready, cd into the ```tensorflow``` directory with

```
cd ~/tensorflow
```

If you used a pre-trained model, the default programs should work. Let's run the Pi Camera Script with

```
python TF-PiCamera-OD.py
```

If you are using a Custom Object Detection Model, the usage for the Pi Camera Script looks like

```
usage: TF-PiCamera-OD.py [-h] [--model MODEL] [--labels LABELS]
                         [--threshold THRESHOLD]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --model MODEL         Folder that the Saved Model is Located In
  --labels LABELS       Where the Labelmap is Located
  --threshold THRESHOLD
                        Minimum confidence threshold for displaying detected
                        objects
```

If you were wondering about the arguments taken by the other programs, just use -h or --help after the command. An example command would look like

```
python TF-PiCamera-OD.py --model od-models --labels od-models/labelmap.pbtxt
```

It takes about 3 minutes for the model to load, but a window with results should open up. Your ouputs should look something like this

Congratulations! This means we're successfully performing real-time object detection on the Raspberry Pi! Now that you've tried out the Pi Camera, why not one of the other scripts? Over the next weeks I'll continue to add on to this repo and tinker with the programs to make them better than ever! If you find something cool, feel free to share it, as others can also learn! And if you have any errors, just raise an issue and I'll be happy to take a look at it. Great work, and until next time, bye!
